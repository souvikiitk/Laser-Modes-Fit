This is a simple non-linear regression model using lmfit, to process beam profiles.
The code determines the percentage of each TEM mode, based on intensity in a beam profile by fitting the image into the mathematical models of a TEM mode.

Caution:
Works the best with Greyscale images, and is also tuned to work with jet colormaps, using other colormaps instead of these two may result in unexpected results.
